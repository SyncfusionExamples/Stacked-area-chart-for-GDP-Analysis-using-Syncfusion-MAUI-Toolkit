# Stacked area chart for GDP Analysis using Syncfusion MAUI Toolkit
This sample demonstrates how to create a stacked area chart for GDP analysis using Syncfusion MAUI Toolkit. Enhance data visualization with interactive features like series highlighting, customized trackball, and data grid integration for seamless user insights.

### Introduction
Effectively analyzing multi-series data in charts can be challenging, especially when multiple series overlap or have closely placed data points. Highlighting a series based on user interaction allows users to focus on a specific data series, improving clarity and making comparisons more intuitive. This enhances the user experience by reducing visual clutter and making key trends stand out.

### Key Features
•	Highlighting a series when interacting with the chart.<br>
•	Dynamically updating a DataGrid to reflect the selected data segment.</br>
•	Synchronizing the trackball and DataGrid to highlight relevant data. <br>
•	Programmatically triggering the trackball from the DataGrid.</br>
•	Exporting the chart as an image for easy sharing and reporting.<br>
•	Dynamically changing the continent selection, updating the chart data accordingly.</br>
